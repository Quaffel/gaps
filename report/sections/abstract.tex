\chapter{Abstract}
As part of the Artificial Intelligence (3IN1007) Bachelor class taught by Prof. Dr. Christos Dimitrakakis at the University of Neuch√¢tel, we were tasked with implementing a program using artificial intelligence concepts. In our project, we focused on developing three primary algorithms based on three exploration to find a solution path for a solitaire game called Gaps. The algorithms we implemented are Greedy BFS, A$^*$, which was covered in class, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which we explored independently.
